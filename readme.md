## Hstsethi's No Frills Dotfiles

This is my personal collection of dotfiles that follow the guidelines mentioned in manifesto below.

The pictures below  were randomly taken during my work. I didn't setup these programs this way just for taking screenshots. They aim to show the real picture of how my workflow is like.

## Configurations Not Available Here

- Music Player
  
    Because I don't listen to music.

- Video Player
  
    I don't watch videos. If I do, I  stick with default mpv, ffplay.

- Wallpaper Utility

- Web Browser
 
   I mostly use Librewolf with JavaScript disabled, Elinks with default configuration.

- Grub Config

  Because It is specific to machine. Instead I have provided grub template which I use with `grub2-mkconfig`. It sets max cpu to 4, disables framebuffer and splash screen.

- Image Editor

I mostly use Imagemagick from command line for cropping, chopping, resizing. I just guess the required chop size and it often works. For trivial tasks, I use Gimp.


## No Frills Dotfiles Manifesto

- Efficiency, time savings over aesthetic.

- Don't fix it until it's broken. Don't customize unless required.

- Document everything. Explain what did you do and why.

- Keyboard over mouse.

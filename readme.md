## Hstsethi's No Frills Dotfiles

This is my personal collection of dotfiles that follow the guidelines mentioned in manifesto below.

The pictures below  were randomly taken during my work. I didn't setup these programs this way just for taking screenshots. They aim to show the real picture of how my workflow is like.

## No Frills Dotfiles Manifesto

- Efficiency, time savings over aesthetic.

- Don't fix it until it's broken. Don't customize unless required.

- Document everything. Explain what did you do and why.

- Keyboard over mouse.
